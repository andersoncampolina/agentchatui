# Agent UI - Project Brief

## Project Overview

Agent UI is an open-source Next.js web application that provides a simple but powerful interface to connect with many AI models and agent/automation tools, such as n8n and others via webhooks. It allows users to input prompts and receive AI-generated responses, including image generation capabilities. The project also plans to support MCP (Multi-Capability Platform/Protocol) connections in the near future.

## Core Requirements

1. Provide a clean, intuitive interface for users to interact with AI services
2. Support text-to-image generation with models like GPT-Image-1
3. Display AI-generated content (images and text) with proper formatting
4. Handle API requests to AI services via webhook integration

## Goals

- Create a responsive, modern UI for AI interactions, similar to an OpenAI or Anthropic chat interface
- Ensure smooth user experience during loading/generation states
- Support various AI capabilities and global connectivity with any agent as the project evolves
- Implement real-time functionality for immediate feedback
- Provide an intuitive and easy-to-understand interface for users to interact with AI services

## Project Scope

- Frontend application built with Next.js and React
- Integration with external AI services via API
- Responsive design for multiple device types
- Modern UI with animations and clean aesthetics

## Non-Goals (Current Phase)

- User authentication and management (may be added later)
- Complex AI model fine-tuning options
- Data storage and analysis features

## Key Stakeholders

- End-users: People who will interact with AI through the interface
- Developers: Team maintaining and extending the application
- AI Service Providers: External systems powering the AI capabilities
