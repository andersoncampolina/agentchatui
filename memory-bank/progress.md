# Progress

## What Works

- Project scaffolding with Next.js, React, and TypeScript
- Basic UI components setup with Tailwind CSS styling
- Main page layout with Agent UI branding
- InputChat component with textarea and submit button
- Loading states during API requests
- Display of generated images with base64 encoding
- Error handling for API communication failures

## What's In Progress

- API webhook implementation for AI service communication
- Enhanced image display options
- Animation improvements for smoother transitions
- Error message refinement for better user feedback

## What's Left to Build

1. API Routes

   - Implementation of the n8nWebhook API endpoint
   - Error handling middleware for API requests
   - Response formatting and validation

2. Features

   - Conversation history to maintain context
   - Support for additional AI models
   - Save/download options for generated content
   - User preferences for model selection

3. UI Enhancements

   - Mobile-responsive design improvements
   - Dark/light mode toggle
   - More advanced animations and transitions
   - Accessibility improvements

4. Performance Optimizations
   - Image loading and caching strategies
   - API request optimization
   - Component rendering performance

## Current Status

The project is in the early development phase with a functional UI prototype. The core components for user interaction are implemented, but the backend API integration is still being developed. The application can display UI elements and handle user input, but full AI service integration is pending.

## Known Issues

- The API endpoint for n8nWebhook needs to be implemented
- Error handling needs improvement for various failure scenarios
- The UI is not fully responsive on all device sizes
- No persistent storage for conversation history
- Limited model options currently available

## Recent Achievements

- Successfully set up the project with modern React and Next.js
- Implemented the core UI components with clean design
- Created the input interface for user prompts
- Set up the image display functionality
