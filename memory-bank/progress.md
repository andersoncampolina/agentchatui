# Progress

## What Works

- Project scaffolding with Next.js, React, and TypeScript
- Basic UI components setup with Tailwind CSS styling
- Main page layout with Agent UI branding
- InputChat component with textarea and submit button
- Loading states during API requests implemented with PulseLoader
- Display of generated images with base64 encoding
- Error handling for API communication failures
- FormatMarkdown component with syntax highlighting for code blocks
- FadeInText component for animated text display
- n8nWebhook API route for communication with external services
- Responsive design for mobile devices in FormatMarkDown and InputChat components
  - Proper overflow handling for code blocks and content
  - Adaptive font sizes and spacing for different screen sizes
  - Optimized UI layouts for mobile interaction

## What's In Progress

- API webhook implementation for AI service communication
- Enhanced image display options
- Animation improvements for smoother transitions
- Error message refinement for better user feedback
- OpenAI API integration for direct model access
- Model response processing and formatting
- Extending responsive design patterns to remaining components

## What's Left to Build

1. API Routes

   - Complete implementation of OpenAI API endpoints
   - Error handling middleware for API requests
   - Response formatting and validation
   - Support for more AI service providers

2. Features

   - Conversation history to maintain context
   - Support for additional AI models
   - Save/download options for generated content
   - User preferences for model selection
   - Real-time streaming responses

3. UI Enhancements

   - Dark/light mode toggle
   - More advanced animations and transitions
   - Accessibility improvements
   - UI components for different response types
   - Fine-tuning responsive behavior for more complex UI elements

4. Performance Optimizations
   - Image loading and caching strategies
   - API request optimization
   - Component rendering performance
   - Error boundary implementation
   - Mobile-specific performance optimization

## Current Status

The project is in the early development phase with a functional UI prototype and initial API integration. The core components for user interaction are implemented, including the chat interface and n8n webhook integration. The application can display both text responses with markdown formatting and images from base64 data. The project structure follows the recommended three-tier component architecture. Recent improvements have focused on ensuring the UI is responsive across different device sizes.

## Known Issues

- No persistent storage for conversation history
- Limited model options currently available
- Error handling needs improvement for various failure scenarios
- No proper loading indicators for long-running operations
- Some complex markdown outputs may still need responsive refinement

## Recent Achievements

- Successfully implemented the InputChat component with n8n webhook integration
- Created FormatMarkdown component for rendering rich-text responses
- Added FadeInText component for animated text display
- Implemented n8nWebhook API route for external service communication
- Set up proper project structure with UI, common, and application components
- Enhanced FormatMarkDown.tsx with responsive design for mobile devices
  - Added overflow handling for code blocks
  - Implemented responsive typography
  - Added proper table handling with horizontal scrolling
- Improved InputChat.tsx for better mobile experience
  - Fixed overflow issues with chat messages
  - Optimized input area for mobile keyboards
  - Added responsive spacing and sizing
