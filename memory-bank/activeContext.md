# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is on implementing core UI components and API routes for the Agent UI project, specifically:

1. Building and enhancing UI components for chat interface
2. Implementing API integration with n8n webhook functionality
3. Adding support for text and image responses from AI models
4. Improving responsiveness and user experience

## Recent Changes

- Implemented `InputChat.tsx` component with functionality to send messages to n8n webhook
- Created `FormatMarkdown.tsx` for proper rendering of markdown content in AI responses
- Added `FadeInText.tsx` component for smooth text animation effects
- Implemented n8nWebhook API route to handle communication with external services
- Set up basic project structure with Next.js and React components
- Added styling with Tailwind CSS

## Next Steps

1. Implement conversation history to maintain context between interactions
2. Complete the OpenAI API endpoints for direct model integration
3. Enhance error handling and user feedback for API failures
4. Add mobile-responsive design improvements for better user experience on smaller devices
5. Implement save/download options for generated content
6. Add user preferences for model selection

## Active Decisions

- **State Management**: Currently using local component state with React's useState, considering context API if complexity increases
- **Styling**: Using Tailwind CSS with custom color variables for consistent theming
- **API Architecture**: Using Next.js API routes with webhook integration for external service communication
- **Component Structure**: Three-tier component architecture (ui, common, application) with clear separation of concerns
- **Response Handling**: Using ReactMarkdown with syntax highlighting for code blocks and proper formatting

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring responsive performance during image generation requests
- Managing proper error states for network issues or API failures
- Optimizing the display of various content types (text vs. images)
- Balancing UI simplicity with feature richness
- Handling different response formats from various AI services

## User Feedback Incorporation

No user feedback has been collected yet as the project is in the initial development stage. Once the core functionality is implemented, user testing will begin to gather feedback on:

- Chat interface usability
- Image generation quality and display
- Overall application performance
- Feature requests and pain points
