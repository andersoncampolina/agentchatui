# Active Context

## Current Focus

1. Core UI components for chat interface
2. API integration with n8n webhooks and OpenAI
3. Text and image response support
4. Responsive design for all devices
5. Animation and user experience improvements

## Recent Changes

- Implemented `InputChat.tsx` for sending messages to n8n webhook
- Created `FormatMarkdown.tsx` for rendering markdown responses
- Added `FadeInText.tsx` for text animation
- Implemented n8nWebhook API route
- Set up OpenAI API routes structure
- Enhanced responsive design for mobile devices
  - Improved overflow handling for code blocks
  - Fixed mobile layout issues
- Added Tailwind CSS v4 with modern configuration
- Using React 19 with latest features
- Set up Turbopack for faster development

## Next Steps

1. Implement audio message sending capability
2. Implement conversation history
3. Complete OpenAI API endpoints implementation
4. Enhance error handling
5. Add save/download options for content
6. Implement model selection preferences
7. Add dark/light mode support with next-themes

## Current Decisions

- **State Management**: Using React useState for component state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom variables
- **API Architecture**: Next.js API routes with webhooks
- **Component Structure**: Three-tier architecture (ui, common, application)
- **Response Handling**: ReactMarkdown with syntax highlighting
- **Responsive Strategy**: Tailwind responsive modifiers
- **Build System**: Using Turbopack for development

## Current Challenges

- Audio message handling implementation
- Responsive performance for image generation
- Error handling for network issues
- Mobile display optimization
- Balancing simplicity with features
- Handling different response formats
- Optimizing real-time feedback

## User Feedback Incorporation

No user feedback has been collected yet as the project is in the initial development stage. Once the core functionality is implemented, user testing will begin to gather feedback on:

- Chat interface usability on both desktop and mobile
- Image generation quality and display across different screen sizes
- Overall application performance on various devices
- Feature requests and pain points
- Mobile-specific interaction patterns and improvements
