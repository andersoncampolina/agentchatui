# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initial development phase with a focus on establishing the core UI components and API integration. The main emphasis is on:

1. Building a functional chat interface that can send prompts to AI services
2. Properly displaying AI-generated images with appropriate loading states
3. Setting up the webhook integration for external AI services
4. Implementing basic UI animations for a polished user experience

## Recent Changes

- Initial project setup with Next.js 15.3.1 and React 19
- Implementation of the core InputChat component for user interactions
- Integration with the image generation API endpoint
- Addition of loading states and error handling in the UI
- Implementation of the FadeInText animation component

## Next Steps

1. Implement the API route for the n8nWebhook to properly handle AI service communication
2. Add conversation history functionality to maintain context between interactions
3. Enhance the image display capabilities with zoom and save options
4. Improve error handling with more user-friendly error messages
5. Add support for additional AI models beyond image generation

## Active Decisions

- **State Management**: Currently using local component state with React's useState, considering context API if complexity increases
- **Styling**: Using Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development with utility classes
- **API Architecture**: Using Next.js API routes with the fetch API for external service communication
- **Component Structure**: Three-tier component architecture (ui, common, application) for better organization

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring responsive performance during image generation requests
- Managing proper error states for network issues or API failures
- Optimizing the display of various content types (text vs. images)
- Balancing UI simplicity with feature richness

## User Feedback Incorporation

No user feedback has been collected yet as the project is in the initial development stage. Once the core functionality is implemented, user testing will begin to gather feedback on:

- Chat interface usability
- Image generation quality and display
- Overall application performance
- Feature requests and pain points
