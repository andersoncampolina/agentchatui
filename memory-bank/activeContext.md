# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is on re-initializing and comprehensively updating the Memory Bank. This involves:

1. Reviewing all existing Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
2. Incorporating information from `README.md` and the "Agent UI Project Intelligence" guidelines.
3. Preparing for a detailed analysis of the existing codebase to ensure the Memory Bank accurately reflects the project's current state and structure.

## Recent Changes

- Read all existing Memory Bank files.
- Read `README.md`.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` based on `README.md`.
- Updated `systemPatterns.md` based on "Agent UI Project Intelligence".
- Currently updating `activeContext.md`.

## Next Steps

1. Finalize updates to `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.
2. Conduct a systematic review of the project's codebase (directory structure, key components, API routes) to further refine the Memory Bank.
3. Identify specific areas of the code to read and understand in detail, focusing on core functionality described in the updated `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`.
4. Update `.cursorrules` with any newly discovered patterns or project intelligence.

## Active Decisions

- **State Management**: Currently using local component state with React's useState, considering context API if complexity increases
- **Styling**: Using Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development with utility classes
- **API Architecture**: Using Next.js API routes with the fetch API for external service communication
- **Component Structure**: Three-tier component architecture (ui, common, application) for better organization

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring responsive performance during image generation requests
- Managing proper error states for network issues or API failures
- Optimizing the display of various content types (text vs. images)
- Balancing UI simplicity with feature richness

## User Feedback Incorporation

No user feedback has been collected yet as the project is in the initial development stage. Once the core functionality is implemented, user testing will begin to gather feedback on:

- Chat interface usability
- Image generation quality and display
- Overall application performance
- Feature requests and pain points
