# Active Context

## Current Focus

1. Core UI components for chat interface
2. API integration with n8n webhooks
3. Text and image response support
4. Responsive design for all devices

## Recent Changes

5. Add save/download options for content
6. Implement model selection preferences

## Current Decisions

- **State Management**: Using React useState
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom variables
- **API Architecture**: Next.js API routes with webhooks
- **Component Structure**: Three-tier architecture (ui, common, application)
- **Response Handling**: ReactMarkdown with syntax highlighting
- **Responsive Strategy**: Tailwind responsive modifiers

## Current Challenges

- Audio message handling implementation
- Responsive performance for image generation
- Error handling for network issues
- Mobile display optimization
- Balancing simplicity with features
- Handling different response formats

## User Feedback Incorporation

No user feedback has been collected yet as the project is in the initial development stage. Once the core functionality is implemented, user testing will begin to gather feedback on:

- Chat interface usability on both desktop and mobile
- Image generation quality and display across different screen sizes
- Overall application performance on various devices
- Feature requests and pain points
- Mobile-specific interaction patterns and improvements
